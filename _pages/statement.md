Words are messy, and so is art, but the difference I decipher between the two is the tolerance granted in reply to very different attempts of organizing the disorderly.

My paintings rely on packaging my quietest yet most insistent words into a digestible and open format. As a young adult in minority groups, I must recognize self-care in the form of communication as a necessity. It is not achievable for myself to be explicit in my needs through words alone. Painting is my form of outspoken advocacy by my own hands.

I refuse to depict anything but the coexistence of bitterness and beauty in my work that my words would not quite articulate. The humanity in speechlessness and the vagueness of my values are urged into the physical and digestible by what takes place within the painted worlds. I place the viewer in a spot to uncover their own views and interpretations from mine.

My creation is neither an echo chamber nor a void, but a conversation to spark new meaning to overlooked and overused words.
 
> "Disorder is disadvantage,"
said sincerely to my face.
> 
> "Disorder is my richest advantage,"
is what my work states silently back.
