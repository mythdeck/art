> What is "ulosis?"

Ulosis, as a word, is a noun in British English that is defined as "the formation of a scar."
To me, it is healing. It is growth. It is survival. These are the most basic forms of my self-advocacy which I reflect in all of my work.
Ulosis is healing is advocacy is art.

## Artist Bio

Missoula-based Myth Indigo is a young artist who displays their life on painted canvasses for all to see. Diving deep into every aspect of first-hand experiences as a member of marginalized populations, he directly advocates for himself through their vivid works that demand to be seen when words can't be heard. Influenced by advocates in their personal spaces, Myth similarly shouts with her own visual voice to make way for those who they believe deserve a chance to speak.

> Myth has been featured in local galleries and publications, and is an active participant in The Western Montana Community Center's creative markets.
