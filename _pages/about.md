## Intro

Myth (he/she/they) is a current painting BFA student in The University of Montana's class of 2026. Located in Missoula, MT. They are a queer, neurodivergent, disabled artist who self-advocates through his work and aims to uplift marginalized experiences through the visual representations of her own.

> What is "ulosis?"

Ulosis, as a word, is a noun in British English that is defined as "the formation of a scar."
To me, it is healing. It is growth. It is survival. These are the most basic forms of my self-advocacy which I reflect in all of my work.
Ulosis is healing is advocacy is art.


## Artist Bio

Missoula-based Myth Indigo is a young artist who displays their life on painted canvasses for all to see. Diving deep into every aspect of first-hand experiences as a member of marginalized populations, he directly advocates for himself through their vivid works that demand to be seen when words can't be heard. Influenced by advocates in their personal spaces, Myth similarly shouts with her own visual voice to make way for those who they believe deserve a chance to speak.

> Myth has been featured in local galleries and publications, and is an active participant in The Western Montana Community Center's creative markets.


## Artist Statement

Words are messy, and so is art, but the difference I decipher between the two is the tolerance granted in reply to very different attempts of organizing the disorderly.

My paintings rely on packaging my quietest yet most insistent words into a digestible and open format. As a young adult in minority groups, I must recognize self-care in the form of communication as a necessity. It is not achievable for myself to be explicit in my needs through words alone. Painting is my form of outspoken advocacy by my own hands.

I refuse to depict anything but the coexistence of bitterness and beauty in my work that my words would not quite articulate. The humanity in speechlessness and the vagueness of my values are urged into the physical and digestible by what takes place within the painted worlds. I place the viewer in a spot to uncover their own views and interpretations from mine.

My creation is neither an echo chamber nor a void, but a conversation to spark new meaning to overlooked and overused words.
 
> "Disorder is disadvantage,"
said sincerely to my face.
> 
> "Disorder is my richest advantage,"
is what my work states silently back.
